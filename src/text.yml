tutorial:
  start: >
    Hey <@${this.user}>! Welcome to my tutorial. First thing's first, let's
    rename your club's channel to something more presentable (it's currently
    <#${this.channel}>). Run this command \`/rename-channel
    new-channel-name\` (with your own channel name)
  alreadyStarted: >
    Go ahead and rename your channel with \`/rename-channel\`. If you're not
    sure what to do next, go ahead and send a screenshot of this message to
    <@U0C7B14Q3>.
  renamedChannel: >
    Now that we've renamed <#${this.channel}>, I'll show you how to record a
    club meeting. First, I'll need to know when your first club meeting is.
    You can show me by typing \`/meeting-time next tuesday at 3 pm\`.
  setMeetingTime: > 
    Great! Now I'll roleplay what will happen right after your first meeting
    by posting in <#${this.channel}>

    - 'Do you ever try to remember something, but end up thinking \`${this.err}\` instead? Wait... what were we talking about?'
    - 'Hmmm... I’m having trouble thinking right now. Whenever I focus, \`${this.err}\` is the only thing that comes to mind'
